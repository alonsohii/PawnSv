	Description:		GTO is a gamemode for SA:MP server (http:sa-mp.com/).
						GTO introduces Experience and Level based character development system and saving of stats and
						items for persistent online world style of gameplay in San Andreas: Multiplayer.
						Very much a WIP, probably very buggy, Just a fun side project, no real plans development wise.


						Features:

						* Level System - Character XP/Levels gain systenm.
										 Higher level = more health, more money, better weapons, etc.
						* Gangs - players can create and join gangs which are saved. Some XP is shared among gang members.
						* Weapons - players must purchase thier weapon upgrades from ammunation
									with more weapons becoming available as they increase levels.
						* Race Modes - Gain experience & money from winning races or beating race records.
						* Deathmatch Modes - Gain experience and money in deathmatch battles.
						* Database system for saving of stats and config.
						* Gain money/xp for holding and protecting turf (pirate ship, etc).
						* Tracking of kills and deaths.
						* Passive health regen, based on level.
						* Pay system, constant income of money.
						* health/money cheat protection
						* Account system.
						* Totaly original and custom ideas and script

						
						Shoutouts to the SA-MP team, http:/sa-mp.com/. Cheers guys, i love the work and look forward to seeing updates.
						And everyone on the SA-MP forums, lots of good info and help there by too many peaple to mention here.


  Gameplay:

  						This gamemode is open, there's no specific win / endgame conditions to meet.
  						In Grand Theft Online you must gain experience in order to increase your level.
						Increasing experience points increases your level, which effects your spawn weapons, health, cashflow and much more.
						Experience points can be gained by killing people, winning races, holding ground, and more.
						Bank your money at 24/7's so you dont loose it all when you die.
						Players can create gangs to team up against opposing gangs and players.
						When in a gang some of your experience gained will be given to your gang members.
						Particapating in races and events can be a good way to earn money and experience.
						

 Installation:

						To run precompiled .amx file:
							Put GTO.amx in your \samp\gamemodes\ directory and change gamemode in server.cfg to GTO.

						To compile GTO yourself:
							Extract gto.pwn to wherever you want, and put all the include files in the same directory as gto.pwn (keeping original directory structure).
							Then just open gto.pwn in pawno and hit Build>Compile (or press F5).
							Ignore the warning messages (warning 208). It will creat gto.amx file in same directory as gto.pwn.

						Scriptfiles:
						    GTO relies upon certain directories it uses to store database information to be present.
						    If they dont exist then GTO will crash, it cant create them itself (not possible with samp 0.1b?).
						    You must copy the whole scriptfiles directory structure (included with GTO release) into your samp folder.

							Or if you wish to manualy create them yourself, this is what folders GTO needs (in your samp directory):
						    'scriptfiles\'
						    'scriptfiles\GTO\'
						    'scriptfiles\GTO\Config\'
						    'scriptfiles\GTO\Player\'
						    'scriptfiles\GTO\Account\'
						    'scriptfiles\GTO\Gang\'
						    'scriptfiles\GTO\Weapon\'
						    'scriptfiles\GTO\Vehicle\'
						    'scriptfiles\GTO\Race\
						    'scriptfiles\GTO\Race\Record\'
						    'scriptfiles\GTO\Deathmatch\'
						    'scriptfiles\GTO\Deathmatch\Record\'
						    'scriptfiles\GTO\Housing\'
						    'scriptfiles\GTO\Business\'
						    
						    If just one of those folders doesnt exist GTO will crash. So make sure they are correct.
						    
						    

 Configuration:
 
                     Database:
 				        Many configurable options in gto are held in database or config files.
						All database and config files are held in 'scriptfiles\GTO\' folders.
						Ive no time to explain them all here, so just have a look around for yourself.
						Most is prety self explaneratory anyway.
 
                    Source:
 				        Some configurable options in gto are currently held in the source code, so you must find them then recompile after changing them.
						Usualy if its a simple configurable option, you will find what you want to change at the top of the most relevently named *.inc file.
						Feel free to change whatever you want.

	Notes:
					All spawn points for player,items,cars,etc are copied from gamemodes released by SA:MP team. Eventualy i will change them, to be more level based.
					I have used a few functions and lines of code from forum posts and such, where permision is given,
					sometimes after a bit of modification. Credits for them go to thier respective aurthor
					who will be listed in a comment just before the function/code snippet.

                  	Anyone can freely contact me with questions, changes, additions, suggestions, bugs, etc
                  	I have no patience for tech support though.
                  	Sorry about any messy code, lack of comments and quick hacks. If you see anything particularly bad then let me know and i will fix it.
